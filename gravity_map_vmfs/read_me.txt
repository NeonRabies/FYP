Just put "maps" folder into "\Steam\steamapps\common\Portal 2\sdk_content\".

"maps" folder includes one .vmf file from my latest Gravity Redirector chamber and "instances" folder.
You must have those instances installed or else you won't see anything correctly in P2 Authoring tools/Hammer editor.

I hope these give you some kind of direction and feel free to ask if you need to know something else !
