files to look into:
	physics.cpp
	View.cpp
	Convar.cpp //seems like something to do with passing data between classes
	ViewRender.cpp // massive 
	GameMovement.ccp //start gravity function *******this has been modified, now when i jump a different gravity direction is applied :D

Nevik: Not exactly, their like console commands
Nevik: They can be made inside the engine
Nevik: I forget where they're made but you'll find out

hammer textures:
matsys.regressiontest
